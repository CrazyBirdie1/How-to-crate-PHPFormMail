# How-to-crate-PHPFormMail
PHPFormMail is a universal WWW form to e-mail gateway.. PHPFormMail's main goal is to seamlessly take the place of it's PERL sister. All functions from PERL FormMail have an exact duplicate in PHPFormMail. PHPFormMail also has some extra functions built in, where ever you see a "*" (red star) is a new feature. Special thanks to Matt's Script Archive (http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts) for if it wasn't for him/them/her (?) there would be no FormMail period. =:^)  There is only one required form input tag which must be specified in order for this script to work with your existing forms. Other hidden configuration fields can also be used to enhance the operation of FormMail on your site.  The anonymous WWW user must have the ability to read the PHPFormMail.php script. If you have problems running a script with the .php extension, try .php3, .phtm, .phtml. If those do not work, please check with your system administrator for more help on running PHP scripts.  Please be sure not to put the formmail.php in your cgi-bin directory unless your web host tells you to. There is no need to make your php scripts executable.
